# BettrPy

BettrPy is supposed to make python code shorter the slightest bit and also add some other features.
It is made with and is recommended to use Python 3 when using BettrPy.

 There are features such as:
 
 * Terminal colors
 * Infinite threads
 * Infinite variables
 * Easy file management
 * Run a command in a virtual terminal
 * Check if a file exists (or a directory)
 * Printing lists without the square brackets
 * Printing files

## Installation

There will be a little build script for Linux on the main page but there isn't too much support for Windows and MacOS yet.

### What does the build script do?

Here is a step by step thing it does:
  1: Installs bettrpy.py
  2: Gets all dependencies
  3: Moves bettrpy.py to the usual site-directory folder
  4: All done!

### Dependencies

For all those people who are on MacOS or Windows,  
the dependencies are:
  * wget
  * readline
  * random
  * math
  * subprocess
  * os
  * sys
  * threading
  * platform

Most of these are pre-installed in Python usually :D

## Importing BettrPy

**It is pretty simple;** just use `import bettrpy`.  
  
Or, to get rid of that useless bettrpy part from all the functions,   
just use `from bettrpy import *`.
  
  
I recommend importing all the functions, most of them all work together :D
